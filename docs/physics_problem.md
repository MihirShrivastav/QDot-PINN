## 1. Physical System: Double Quantum Dots in Semiconductors

### What are Quantum Dots?

Quantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor structures that confine electrons, creating discrete energy levels similar to atoms. They are often called "artificial atoms" because of this quantization. 

**3D → 2D Reduction**: While real quantum dots confine electrons in all three dimensions, we focus on **2D quantum wells** where:
- **Strong z-confinement**: Tight confinement in the vertical direction (z) creates a large energy gap to excited z-states
- **2D dynamics**: At low temperatures, only the ground z-state is occupied, reducing the problem to 2D motion in the (x,y) plane
- **Effective 2D system**: The 3D Schrödinger equation separates, and we solve the 2D problem with an effective 2D potential

In our case, we study **double quantum dots (DQDs)** - two closely spaced 2D quantum wells that allow electrons to tunnel between them in the x-y plane.

### GaAs Material System: Why This Choice Matters

We specifically target **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** semiconductors because it's the **gold standard for quantum dot research**:

**Quantum Advantages**:
- **Low effective mass**: m* = 0.067 m₀ → larger quantum effects, stronger confinement
- **High dielectric constant**: εᵣ ≈ 12.9 → reduced Coulomb interactions, cleaner single-particle physics
- **Long coherence times**: Weak spin-orbit coupling → microsecond spin coherence
- **Nuclear spin control**: Isotope purification possible → reduced nuclear noise

**Technological Maturity**:
- **Heterostructures**: AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells with precise control
- **Gate definition**: Established lithography and etching processes
- **Characterization**: Decades of transport and optical measurements
- **Device integration**: Compatible with existing semiconductor technology

**Research Infrastructure**:
- **Material parameters**: Well-known effective mass, g-factors, band structure
- **Fabrication facilities**: Worldwide availability of MBE/MOCVD growth
- **Measurement techniques**: Established protocols for quantum dot characterization
- **Theoretical understanding**: Extensive literature and validated models

### Physical Parameters and Scales

**Why These Scales Matter**:

**Length Scale**: L₀ = 30 nm (typical gate-defined dot size)
- **Quantum confinement**: Comparable to electron de Broglie wavelength λ = h/p ≈ 20-50 nm
- **Fabrication feasible**: Achievable with electron-beam lithography and etching
- **Gate control**: Large enough for electrostatic gate definition
- **Continuum approximation**: Much larger than atomic scale (0.5 nm lattice constant)

**Energy Scale**: E₀ = ℏ²/(2m*L₀²) ≈ 0.63 meV
- **Quantum regime**: Much larger than thermal energy at mK temperatures (kT ≈ 0.001 meV at 10 mK)
- **Controllable**: Accessible with typical gate voltages (mV range)
- **Coherent operation**: Energy scales allow coherent manipulation before decoherence
- **Measurement resolution**: Detectable with sensitive electrometers

**Physical Dimensions and Their Significance**:
- **Dot separation**: 45-90 nm → Controls tunnel coupling exponentially
- **Confinement energies**: 2-8 meV → Sets single-particle level spacing
- **Tunnel coupling**: 0.01-1 meV → Determines qubit operation timescales (ns-μs)
- **Charging energy**: ~1-5 meV → Controls single vs. double occupancy

**2D Approximation: When and Why It's Valid**:

**Separation of Energy Scales**:
- **Vertical confinement**: E_z ≈ 20 meV (quantum well thickness ~10 nm)
- **Lateral confinement**: E_x, E_y ≈ 2-8 meV (dot size ~30 nm)
- **Energy gap**: E_z >> E_x, E_y ensures only ground z-state occupied
- **Temperature condition**: kT ≈ 0.001 meV << E_z at millikelvin temperatures

**Mathematical Justification**:
- **Separable Hamiltonian**: H = H_xy + H_z for thin quantum wells
- **Factorized wavefunction**: Ψ(x,y,z) = ψ(x,y) × φ_0(z)
- **Effective 2D problem**: ∫ φ_0*(z) H φ_0(z) dz → H_eff(x,y)
- **Reduced dimensionality**: 3D eigenvalue problem → 2D eigenvalue problem

**Experimental Validation**:
- **Transport measurements**: Conductance quantization in 2D units (e²/h)
- **Spectroscopy**: Clear separation of z-levels from xy-levels
- **Magnetic field studies**: 2D Landau level structure observed
- **Device operation**: Successful qubit operation confirms 2D physics

**Limitations and Extensions**:
- **Thick wells**: Approximation breaks down for well width > 20 nm
- **Strong fields**: High magnetic fields can mix z-levels
- **Interface roughness**: Scattering can couple z-states
- **3D effects**: Finite thickness corrections for precise quantitative predictions

## 2. The Quantum Mechanical Problem

### Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation

The fundamental equation we solve is the eigenvalue problem:

```
Ĥψ(x,y) = Eψ(x,y)
```

where:
- **Ĥ = -ℏ²/(2m*)∇² + V(x,y)** is the Hamiltonian operator
- **ψ(x,y)** is the wavefunction (complex amplitude)
- **E** is the energy eigenvalue
- **V(x,y)** is the confining potential

### Physical Interpretation

**Wavefunction ψ(x,y)**:
- Complex-valued function describing quantum state
- |ψ(x,y)|² = probability density of finding electron at (x,y)
- Must be normalized: ∫|ψ|² dxdy = 1
- Continuous and differentiable (kinetic energy requirement)

**Energy Eigenvalues E**:
- Discrete energy levels due to confinement
- Ground state E₀ (lowest energy, no nodes)
- Excited states E₁, E₂, ... (higher energy, nodal structures)
- Energy differences determine tunneling rates and device properties

### Boundary Conditions

**Soft Confinement** (our approach):
- Potential V(x,y) grows smoothly outside dots
- No hard boundary conditions required
- More realistic for gate-defined dots
- Wavefunction decays exponentially in barriers

**Alternative: Hard Walls**:
- ψ = 0 at boundaries (infinite potential)
- Simpler mathematically but less realistic
- Creates artificial reflections and standing waves

## 3. Double Quantum Dot Potential Landscapes

### Potential Landscape Models

We implement two complementary potential families to model realistic gate-defined quantum dots:

#### 1. Biquadratic Double Well (Primary Model)

```
V(x,y) = c₄(x² - a²)² + c₂ᵧy² + δx
```

**Physical Meaning**:
- **c₄(x² - a²)²**: Creates two wells at x = ±a with smooth barrier
- **c₂ᵧy²**: Harmonic confinement in transverse direction
- **δx**: Linear detuning (energy difference between dots)
- **a**: Half-separation between dot centers

**Parameter Control**:
- **Tunnel coupling**: Controlled by c₄ (barrier height/width)
- **Dot size**: Controlled by c₄, c₂ᵧ (confinement strength)
- **Energy detuning**: Controlled by δ (gate voltage difference)

#### 2. Gaussian Double Well (Alternative Model)

```
V(x,y) = v_off - v₀[exp(-((x-a)² + y²)/σ²) + exp(-((x+a)² + y²)/σ²)] + v_b·exp(-x²/σ_b²) + δx
```

**Physical Meaning**:
- **Gaussian wells**: Two attractive wells at (±a, 0) with depth v₀ and width σ
- **Central barrier**: Repulsive Gaussian barrier with height v_b and width σ_b
- **Offset v_off**: Sets overall potential level
- **Linear detuning δx**: Energy difference between dots

**Advantages**:
- **More realistic**: Better models gate-defined electrostatic potentials
- **Flexible geometry**: Independent control of well size and barrier properties
- **Smooth everywhere**: No artificial sharp features
- **Tunable coupling**: Barrier height directly controls tunnel coupling
